/*
 * Learning notes
 *
 * Dynamic Route Handler
 * - `[...path]` matches every nested URL below `/api`.
 * - The browser path and query string are forwarded to the fixed Express
 *   origin; the browser never supplies a destination origin.
 *
 * Request forwarding
 * - GET and HEAD requests cannot contain a request body.
 * - Other methods forward the original text, content type, cookie, and abort
 *   signal. User media will use direct signed CDN uploads instead of this path.
 * - The Express response is returned unchanged, including status and cookies.
 *
 * Failure handling
 * - Express HTTP errors such as 401 and 422 are returned unchanged.
 * - Transport error details are visible only during local development.
 *   Production returns a generic message to avoid leaking internal details.
 *
 * Temporary architecture
 * - Next.js 14.1 and 16.3 both support App Router Route Handlers.
 * - Production Nginx will eventually route `/api/*` directly to Express, so
 *   this temporary application-level proxy can then be removed.
