 * Learning notes
 *
 * Server Component shell
 * - The route stays a Server Component. All step state and the signup Action
 *   live in the Client `SignupFlow`, so this file ships no extra JavaScript.
 *
 * Next.js 14.1 comparison
 * - App Router pages were already Server Components by default. Next.js 16
 *   keeps that model and generates metadata from the typed export.
